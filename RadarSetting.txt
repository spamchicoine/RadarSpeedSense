Commands that have a user entered value (n) typically require a return key
To get current respective settings/status just use the "Letter"? convention

==== USE ====
SX = 10k Sample Freq, Reports up to 69.5mph (+/- 0.136)
US (hah) = Change units to mph (default m/s)
F0 = Integer outputs (default decimal)
R>n = Only report speeds above n
R+/- = Report only inbound/outbound direction (may be flipped)
A! - Save current settings to default config on startup
AX - Reset default settings


==== MAY USE ====
R| = Report both directions
K+ = Speed averaging of peak detected values across the nearest two speeds
K- = Disables K+
OJ - Turns output to JSON format
^/+n.n - cosine error correction for inbound
^/+n.n - cosine error correction for outbound
IG - Interrupt on pin3 (J3), pull down when object detected
N? - Get object count (adjusts to filters)
N! - Reset count
N# - Get count without reset
PI - Idle power mode
PA - Active power mode
P! - System reset
M>n -  Only report magnitudes above n
Y<n.n - Alert above speed n.n, output msg and pin2 (J3)

==== Hibernate ====
Radar sends pulses in between hibernate time, if reading matches filters set the radar will stay on.

Z+ = Enable hibernate mode
Z- = Disable hibernate mode
Z=n = Time to hibernate between pulses
Z>n = Time to stay active on after pulse (default is 0.5 seconds)
